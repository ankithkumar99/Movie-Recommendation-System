About Dataset:
<br>
the dataset consists of movies till 2019
<br>
IMDb movies.csv is the file I download from kaggle website(good website to get clean datasets)
<br>
Due to large number of records, I got MemoryError when I run the code.
<br>
So, I had to split the dataset for every 5000 records. These files are stored in Dataset1 folder.
<br>
chunk.py is the code to split the dataset
<br><br><br>
About gui:

<br>

<br>
